    <h2>A HEART WRAPPED IN FUR</h2>
    <p>The <p1>briard</p1>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers, and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
